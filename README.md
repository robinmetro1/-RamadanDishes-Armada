## Description


a Node.js application is designed to address the question of "when to start cooking" during Ramadan. Users input an ingredient and the specific day of Ramadan, and the app provides two key outputs
The idea is that the user provides an ingredient and the Ramadhan day then the  app should return:

1. It identifies dishes containing the provided ingredient and offers guidance on when to start cooking each dish. This timing is calculated relative to the Asr prayer, ensuring that each dish is ready approximately 15 minutes before Maghrib prayer. 
2. It suggests a specific dish featuring the provided ingredient and when to start cooking it.
